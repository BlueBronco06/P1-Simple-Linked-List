## Known Bugs or Issues

In this project I had a few small issues. However, they were mainly related to the nuances of coding in the C programming language and were easy to solve with a quick Google search. One issue that I really struggled with was passing pointers through functions as arguments but I eventually succeded in implementing those fuunctions.

## Experience

Overall I really enjoyed this project. Although I did not learn too much about operating systems or any material that was the focus of this class, I found this exercise to be a confidence booster with the language C as we continue to use it in this class. I also feel much more comfortable using the tools such as the Unity framework and Codespace.
